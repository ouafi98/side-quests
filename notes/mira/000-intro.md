# Measure, Integration & Probability — Sheldon Axler

These notes are my working notes while reading *Measure, Integration & Real Analysis* by Sheldon Axler, which is freely available online at http://measure.axler.net/.

The goal is not completeness, but a solid understanding of the core ideas that
matter for probability theory and modern machine learning.

Any errors, inaccuracies, or mistakes in these notes or in the solutions to the
exercises are entirely my own.
